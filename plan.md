## Current App Layout ✅ Recently Redesigned with Advanced Navigation
- **Navigation System**: Native iOS-style gesture navigation with fluid animations
  - Velocity-based swipe detection (800px/s threshold + 15% screen distance)
  - Direct 1:1 finger tracking during gestures with seamless animation continuation
  - Bidirectional support: right swipe to navigate back, left swipe to cancel
  - Material3 Scaffold with conditional top/bottom bars for smooth transitions
  - Cross-platform BackHandler support (Android physical back + iOS swipe gestures)
- **Top Section**: Compact selection controls in 2x2 grid (Field/Parcel, Row/Position)
  - Uses WindowInsets padding to respect system bars (status bar, navigation bar)  
  - Modern Material3 Surface design with smaller typography
  - Cascading logic: Field → Parcel → Row → Position selection
- **Main Section**: Maximized peony details display area (75% of screen space)
  - Variety name card (no redundant position info) - always displayed when position selected
  - Exact match peony details with cultivar, originator, date, group, description
  - **120dp peony images** displayed alongside details with full async loading on both platforms
  - Fuzzy match suggestions when exact match not found
  - Proper scrolling for long descriptions

## Data Structure

### Field JSONs (4 files)
- `Champ1PP.json`, `Champ2PP.json`, etc. (located in `data/` folder)
- Contains flat array structure with field hierarchy
- Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "champ": "1",
    "parcelle": "1-PP", 
    "rang": "1",
    "trou": "1",
    "variete": "? blanche double",
    "annee_plantation": null,
    "taille": "p",
    "etiquette": null,
    "vente": null
  }
]
```

### Peony Database
- `peony-database.json` (located in `data/` folder)
- Array structure with peony details
- Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1979,
    "cultivar": "A la Mode",
    "originator": "Klehm, R.G.",
    "date": "1981",
    "group": "Lactiflora",
    "description": "Single lactiflora, pure white large flower...",
    "image": "https://americanpeonysociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peony-A-la-Mode.jpg",
    "url": "https://americanpeonysociety.org/cultivars/peony-registry/a-la-mode/"
  }
]
```

## User Flow
1. Select field (champ) → populates parcel spinner
2. Select parcel (parcelle) → populates row spinner  
3. Select row (rang) → populates position spinner
4. Select position (trou) → shows peony variety name + fuzzy matches against peony database by cultivar
5. Display matched peony details with image from URL in main display area

## Architecture Implementation ✅ Complete
- ✅ Clean Repository pattern with interfaces and implementations
