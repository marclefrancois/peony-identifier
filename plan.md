  - Four-screen architecture: FieldSelection â†’ PeonyIdentifier â†’ PeonyDetail + PeonySearch
  - Consistent 300ms horizontal slide animations for all transitions
  - State preservation across navigation (field/parcel/search selections remembered)
  - Cross-platform BackHandler support with iOS gesture navigation integration
  - Search integration with floating action button and cross-screen state preservation

## User Flow

### Traditional Field Selection Flow
1. Select field (champ) â†’ populates parcel spinner
2. Select parcel (parcelle) â†’ populates row spinner  
3. Select row (rang) â†’ populates position spinner
4. Select position (trou) â†’ shows peony variety name + fuzzy matches against peony database by cultivar
5. Display matched peony details with image from URL in main display area

### New Search Flow (v1.6.0)
1. Tap search button from field selection screen â†’ navigate to search interface
2. Type peony variety name â†’ see real-time autocomplete suggestions
3. Select suggestion or perform search â†’ view all field locations containing that variety
4. Tap location result â†’ navigate directly to peony detail with preserved search context
5. Navigate back â†’ return to search results with preserved query and state

## Data Structure

### Field JSONs (3 files)
- `Champ1PP.json`, `Champ1GP.json`, `Champ2PP.json` (located in `composeResources/files/`)
- Contains flat array structure with field hierarchy
- **Champ1PP.json**: Field 1, Parcel PP (original dataset)
- **Champ1GP.json**: Field 1, Parcel GP (4,467 entries)
