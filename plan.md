```json
[
  {
    "champ": "1",
    "parcelle": "1-PP", 
    "rang": "1",

    "variete": "? blanche double",
    "annee_plantation": null,
    "taille": "p",
    "etiquette": null,
    "vente": null
  }
]
```

### Peony Database
- `peony-database.json` (located in `data/` folder)

    "url": "https://americanpeonysociety.org/cultivars/peony-registry/a-la-mode/"
  }
]
```

## User Flow
