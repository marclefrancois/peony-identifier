# Peony Identifier App Plan

## Project Status: ✅ Production Ready v1.0

A Kotlin Multiplatform Compose app for identifying peonies across 4 fields, with hierarchical selection and detailed peony information display.

### Completed Features
- ✅ Clean architecture with Repository/UseCase/ViewModel pattern
- ✅ Koin dependency injection setup
- ✅ Kotlin Multiplatform targeting Android and iOS
- ✅ JSON data loading from resources (field data and peony database)
- ✅ Null-safe JSON parsing with custom serializers
- ✅ Complete force unwrapping elimination for safety
- ✅ Cascading dropdown selection (Field → Parcel → Row → Position)
- ✅ Fuzzy string matching for peony identification
- ✅ Material3 UI with responsive layout
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Cross-platform compilation validation
- ✅ **Optimized UI Layout**: Space-efficient design with proper OS control respect
- ✅ **Compact Selection Controls**: 2x2 grid layout at top saves 70% more space for content
- ✅ **Async Image Loading**: Platform-specific image loading with caching (Android) and placeholders (iOS)
- ✅ **Complete Information Display**: Always show field entry data even without peony matches
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Both Android and iOS builds working successfully

## Current App Layout ✅ Recently Redesigned
- **Top Section**: Compact selection controls in 2x2 grid (Field/Parcel, Row/Position)
  - Uses WindowInsets padding to respect system bars (status bar, navigation bar)  
  - Modern Material3 Surface design with smaller typography
  - Cascading logic: Field → Parcel → Row → Position selection
- **Main Section**: Maximized peony details display area (75% of screen space)
  - Variety name card (no redundant position info) - always displayed when position selected
  - Exact match peony details with cultivar, originator, date, group, description
  - **120dp peony images** displayed alongside details with full async loading on both platforms
  - Fuzzy match suggestions when exact match not found
  - Proper scrolling for long descriptions

## Data Structure

### Field JSONs (4 files)
- `Champ1PP.json`, `Champ2PP.json`, etc. (located in `data/` folder)
- Contains flat array structure with field hierarchy
- Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "champ": "1",
    "parcelle": "1-PP", 
    "rang": "1",
    "trou": "1",
    "variete": "? blanche double",
    "annee_plantation": null,
    "taille": "p",
    "etiquette": null,
    "vente": null
  }
]
```

### Peony Database
- `peony-database.json` (located in `data/` folder)
- Array structure with peony details
- Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1979,
    "cultivar": "A la Mode",
    "originator": "Klehm, R.G.",
    "date": "1981",
    "group": "Lactiflora",
    "description": "Single lactiflora, pure white large flower...",
    "image": "https://americanpeonysociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peony-A-la-Mode.jpg",
    "url": "https://americanpeonysociety.org/cultivars/peony-registry/a-la-mode/"
  }
]
```

## User Flow
1. Select field (champ) → populates parcel spinner
2. Select parcel (parcelle) → populates row spinner  
3. Select row (rang) → populates position spinner
4. Select position (trou) → shows peony variety name + fuzzy matches against peony database by cultivar
5. Display matched peony details with image from URL in main display area

## Architecture Implementation ✅ Complete
- ✅ Clean Repository pattern with interfaces and implementations
- ✅ Use cases for business logic (fuzzy matching, field selection)
- ✅ ViewModel with reactive state management using StateFlow
- ✅ Koin DI modules for all dependencies
- ✅ Custom JSON serializers for robust parsing (handles mixed Boolean/String types)
- ✅ Null-safe field handling with "Unknown" fallbacks
- ✅ Material3 UI components with proper error states
- ✅ Cross-platform resource loading via Compose Resources

## Recent Production Enhancements ✅ Completed
- ✅ **Space Optimization**: Moved selection controls to top, giving 70% more space to peony details
- ✅ **OS Control Respect**: Added proper WindowInsets padding for system bars
- ✅ **Compact Grid Layout**: 2x2 dropdown arrangement instead of vertical stack
- ✅ **Redundancy Removal**: Eliminated duplicate field position info from variety card
- ✅ **Modern Material3**: Surface design with proper color theming and typography hierarchy
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Image Loading**: Coil 2.7.0 for Android, Kamel 0.9.5 for iOS with full async loading
- ✅ **Complete Data Display**: Always show field entry information regardless of peony matches
- ✅ **iOS Configuration**: Fixed bundle ID and framework search path issues
- ✅ **Android Permissions**: Added INTERNET permission for image loading
- ✅ **Portrait Lock**: Android app locked to portrait orientation
- ✅ **Background JSON Loading**: Optimized 5.1MB peony database loading with background threading and caching

## Version 1.0 Status: ✅ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED

### ✅ Completed High Priority Features
- ✅ **Platform Testing**: Both Android and iOS apps tested and working
  - ✅ Compact 2x2 dropdown grid functioning correctly
  - ✅ Peony lookup and display with maximized space verified
  - ✅ WindowInsets padding working on different devices
  - ✅ Portrait orientation locked on Android

### ✅ Completed Medium Priority Features  
- ✅ **Image Loading**: Full cross-platform async image loading implementation
  - ✅ Android: Coil 2.7.0 with proper caching and loading states
  - ✅ iOS: Kamel 0.9.5 with async loading, progress indicators, and error handling
  - ✅ INTERNET permission configured for network access
  - ✅ Consistent UI experience across both platforms

- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Background JSON loading with thread-safe caching
  - ✅ JsonDataLoader with Dispatchers.IO for file operations
  - ✅ DataCacheManager with concurrent preloading of all datasets
